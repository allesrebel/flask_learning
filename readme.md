# Flask Quick Guide

This project is meant to showcase a quick demonstration of how to get a quick
blog going with membership/member restricted content going.

This is meant to be used to as a exercise in learning the basics of flask and scripting

## Getting Started

Ensure that python3 is installed, and that virtual environments are supported
```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```
then run the initialization script:
```
. ./setup_shell init
```

. or simply a space may be needed in order to execute the script in the current shell.
